Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts

designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Supports
1. Inheritance, 
2.libraries and 
3.complex user-defined types

Things to be covered :

Introduction 
Install
Eg of - 4 contracts
Solidity InDepth
	Layout of a Solidity Source File
	Structure of a Contract
	Types
	Units and Globally Available Variables
	Expressions and Control Structures
	Contracts
	Solidity Assembly
	Miscellaneous
	
Contract is made up of 
1. Functions : 
2. States/Data - resides at specific address of Ethereum blockchain

Eg :
uint storedData; 
//1.  declared state variable [storedData
2. Type : uint( 

it is like a slot in DB, that can have CRUD operations
NOTE : here only only the owning contract can do the CRUD operations on the state variables


global variables in Solidity :

msg
tx
block
